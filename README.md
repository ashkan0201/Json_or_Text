# Json_or_Text
Hello, I am Ashkan.

With this code, you understand the decorators, how we have used it for the code we presented?

Now I will explain about this code.
This code opens a file, then tries to read it as json, but if it encounters an error, the program understands that it should read it as text, and even if it encounters an error, it will show a message to the user.

## Installation
```bash
    $ pip install json5
```
or
```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
